## Description

Special Operators are tasked with eliminating a high value target in Al Basrah. The mission is to be completed with stealth, but if the target is alerted, the mission can be completed with force with the consequence of a reactive enemy force. There are also multiple side objectives that can be completed optionally to make future missions easier.


### Mission Series Overview

**Situation Background:**

Location: Al-Basrah, a key city in southern Iraq.

Political Unrest: The region has been plagued by political turmoil and violence due to insurgency activities by numerous factions. The Al-Basrah province holds strategic importance as it houses key infrastructure assets, including oil fields and a major port.

Tensions with Local Militias: Over the past six months, tensions have escalated between the Iraqi government forces and local militias, particularly the Al-Basrah Liberation Front (ABLF). The ABLF is an armed group seeking greater autonomy and control over the province's resources. Their actions include attacks on government installations, targeted assassinations, and extortion.

Government Response: The Iraqi Army, supported by international allies, is preparing an operation to neutralize the ABLF and establish control over the area. Chronic corruption within the local police force has hindered progress, making it crucial for an elite SpecOps team to intervene and secure the success of the mission.

**Intel Report:**

Objective: Your SpecOps team has been deployed to Al-Basrah to gather intelligence, disrupt ABLF operations, and assist the Iraqi Army's campaign to reclaim control of the city.

ABLF Leadership: The ABLF is led by Mustafa Al-Mahdi, a ruthless and resourceful individual with extensive ties to regional militias and terrorist organizations. He is known to employ hit-and-run tactics, making it difficult for the government forces to apprehend or eliminate him.

Weapons and Support: Intelligence suggests that the ABLF possesses a wide range of weaponry sourced from black markets, including small arms, RPGs, and homemade explosives. They often receive financial and material support from external entities through smuggling routes in neighboring countries.

Key Infrastructure Targets: The ABLF's primary objective is to disrupt the region's oil production and export capabilities. They have targeted pipelines, storage facilities, and port installations to undermine the government's economic stability and gain leverage for negotiations.

Civilians at Risk: The local civilian population is caught in the crossfire, facing threats from both the ABLF and government forces. Winning their trust is crucial to gather valuable intel, gain cooperation, and minimize collateral damage during military operations.

Key Challenges: The mission is expected to face several challenges, including:

1. Coordinated Attacks: The ABLF has demonstrated the ability to launch simultaneous attacks across different areas, making it essential to identify and neutralize their cells before their activities escalate.
2. Urban Warfare: Al-Basrah's complex urban landscape poses challenges for both offensive and defensive operations. Narrow streets, tall buildings, and densely populated areas will require precision and awareness to avoid civilian casualties.
3. Complex Network: Disrupting the ABLF's network, which spans across multiple provinces, will require extensive intelligence gathering, infiltration, and targeted strikes.
4. Counterintelligence: The ABLF has informants within the local population and security forces. Identifying and neutralizing these individuals will be crucial to maintain operational security.

Your team will need to leverage your skills, knowledge, and advanced weaponry to dismantle the ABLF, safeguard key infrastructure, and restore stability to the region.
